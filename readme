Abstract : A seminar course was carried out on the topic of clustering.
It involved the mathematical derivation of various clustering algorithms
such as K- Means, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN. I also studied
about the Expectation Maximization algorithm. I created various types
of synthetic datasets and then implemented the algorithms. I found that
each particular algorithm was able to cluster only the particular types
of datasets and this happened because of certain properties of each algo-
rithms. I also studied about the Gaussian Mixture Models and found the
parameters of the model using Expectation Maximization algorithm. All
the required codes were written in MATLAB.
